Alpha AXP MSCGEM OTS C run-time library notes.

- The following OTS source files were obtained an eternity ago from
  an OpenWatcom git repository (hosted by Sybase, interestingly enough).

    otsdiv.asm
    otsdivdat.asm

- The following OTS source files were obtained from Kent Glossop on
  27-Jan-1993. I believe the version number is X1.0-4.

    extv.s
    extvvol.s
    extzv.s
    extzvvol.s

    insv.s
    insvvol.s

    ots_as.hs

    scmpeql.s
    scmpeqlp.s
    scmpleq.s
    scmpleqp.s
    scmplss.s
    scmplssp.s

    sfill.s
    sloc.s
    smove.s
    smovem.s
    strans.s
    szero.s

- The six strcmp/cpy/len functions were obtained through Rich Peterson
  on 25-Jan-1993.

    strcmp.s
    strcmp_.s
    strcpy.s
    strcpy_.s
    strlen.s
    strlen_.s

- For now, and in the interest of maintenance, we have left the source
  files intact in spite of the fact that they don't follow conventions
  of all other NT/Alpha assembler code.

- The following files had a non-ascii 0xa9 character instead of a (c)
  in the copyright line. These have been fixed so slm works right.

    scmpeql.s
    scmpeqlp.s
    scmpleq.s
    scmpleqp.s
    scmplss.s
    scmplssp.s
